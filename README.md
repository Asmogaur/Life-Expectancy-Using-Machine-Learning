# Life-Expectancy-Using-Machine-Learning

- **Project Objective**: Developed an automated AI system to predict the average life expectancy of an individual based on various socio-economic, health, and environmental factors.

- **IBM AI Frameworks**: Utilized IBMâ€™s comprehensive suite of AI tools, including IBM Cloud, IBM Watson, and IBM Machine Learning Instances, to design and deploy the system. These frameworks provided the necessary scalability, security, and computational power.

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Collected diverse datasets comprising health indicators, lifestyle choices, demographic data, and environmental factors. Performed thorough data preprocessing, including normalization, feature extraction, and handling of missing values, to ensure high-quality input for the predictive model.

- **Predictive Model**: Developed a machine learning model using IBM Watson Machine Learning, trained on historical data to estimate life expectancy. Integrated multiple algorithms, such as regression models or decision trees, to identify patterns and relationships between input variables and life expectancy.

- **Deployment on IBM Cloud**: Deployed the model on IBM Cloud to ensure seamless scalability, enabling real-time predictions and easy integration with other services or platforms.

- **Performance & Accuracy**: Optimized the model's performance through continuous training and testing, ensuring reliable predictions with minimal bias.

- **Use Cases**: This AI system can be applied in healthcare analytics, personalized medicine, public health studies, and insurance sectors, helping to make data-driven decisions related to life expectancy.
